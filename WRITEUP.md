# Write-up Template

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*I would choose an App Service
- *Since it is light weight, the size limit for App Services will not be a problem.
- *App Services cost less than VMs do
- *Since scalability is less of a concern we can go with App services
- *Security is best in VM's compared to App services but can be acheived in App service too.



### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*If there is a vast increase in the number of users
*If there is a need for dedicated servers for handling sensitive information.
*It may be necessary in the future if many more features are added then scaling is required.
