### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*I would choose an App Service
- *Since it is light weight, the size limit for App Services will not be a problem.
- *App Services cost less than VMs do
- *Since scalability is less of a concern we can go with App services
- *Security is best in VM's compared to App services but can be acheived in App service too.



### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.*
